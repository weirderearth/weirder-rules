# weirder.earth Rules and Etiquette

We want everyone to have a great time, feel welcome and to let cool ideas flow around. Giving everyone some guidelines helps you all to know what's up and how we can keep this place an enjoyable, fun and interesting place to be.

There's two parts:

- **Rules**: Things that are probably obvious to most people that are hurtful or unpleasant.
- **Etiquette**: Things you might not be aware of that help keep the space awesome for everyone.

---

## Rules

This section covers stuff that is not okay to do here - generally because one way or another, it hurts or represses people.

These may not cover every situation, so moderators can still make decisions at their own discretion.

**These apply to this instance and elsewhere on other instances, other social networks and IRL.**

**Your moderators will take any accusations seriously, and will handle them anonymously.**

<br/>


<br/>

### Groups of people that aren't welcome here

If you have the following or similar kinds of ideologies or affiliations, you are not welcome here and you will be immediately banned if found out:

- Neo-fascism (White supremacy / White nationalism / Neo-nazi / Alt-right / Alt-light / Identitarian / Male supremacy / Manosphere)
- Reactionary (GamerGate / Anti-feminism / Neo-reactionary)
- Neo-feudalism ('Anarcho'-capitalism / 'Objectivism' / Right-wing Libertarians)
- TERF, SWERF or otherwise anti-trans or anti-sex worker
- Truscum, Transmed or other kinds of identity policing.
- People who are generally phobic/shitty towards non-binary genders.
- Religious fundamentalism or anti-abortion. (Other types of religion are A-OK!)
- Militarism, Chauvinism, Ethno-nationalism, Xenophobia or similar.
- Stalinism, Maoism or similar. (Non-authoritarian forms of Socialism and Communism are A-OK!)
- Shitty furries (Nazifurs and any furry that thinks being a bigoted piece of shit is okay!)
- Pro-bestiality/zoophilia

<br/>

If you work in any capacity (whether as a direct employee or a contractor) for any of the following types of organisations, you aren't welcome here, and if you reveal yourself as such, you will be banned:

- Police
- Immigration enforcement
- Intelligence/spy organisations


(This does not mean we will refuse *legally valid* requests for information, it just means that aside from this type of situation, you are not welcome here in any way.)

<br/>

Apart from those listed, if you have any ideology that believes in  - whether violently, non-violently or religiously - the repression of people based on race, gender identity, sexuality and so on, you are also not welcome here.

**Ideologies or affiliations based on controlled *counter-violence* in opposition to oppression (like antifa/antifascism) *are* welcome here.** However, telling oppressed groups how they should or shouldn't oppose their oppression is not.

<br/>


<br/>

### Actions and behaviours that aren't welcome here

This covers a lot of mostly obviously unpleasant stuff.

<br/>

#### Hate speech

We consider the following as hate speech:

Comments, imagery, memes or publications that, either deliberately or unknowingly, demean, dehumanise, malign or otherwise hurt a person or a group of people based on certain characteristics or group status, including but not limited to:

- Race
- Sexuality
- Gender identity, including trans and non-binary gender identities
- Age
- Body size/weight
- Disability
    - This includes insults based on intelligence or mental illness; see [Avoid Ableist Language by Kavana Ramaswamy](https://kavanaramaswamy.com/posts/ableistlanguage/) for commentary on this
- Religion
- Sex work
- Kinks or fetishes
- Certain personas or forms of identity (furries, otherkin, plural systems, etc.)
- Poverty/lack of wealth

Saying things in a particular way, like:

- Racial slurs, ableist slurs, etc.
- Intentional misgendering (intentionally using pronouns or phrasing to refer to someone's gender incorrectly)

<br/>

It's okay to criticise things like religions, but only as long as that isn't
just a wedge/shield for bigotry (eg. using feminist concepts to malign all
forms of Islam instead of rationally talking about the misogynistic actions and
policies of a specific individual or community).

<br/>

Marginalised communities (like PoC or women) being fed up with systemic
problems and complaining about certain groups' lack of understanding or action
about certain issues (ie. white people, men) is not hate speech. If you're not
a part of the problem, you don't need to see it as an attack. :)

<br/>

Deliberate hate speech, even if under a CW, will result in an immediate ban.
When a post contains unintentional hate speech, mods will often reach out to
the poster first - we expect folks to engage in good faith when issues are
pointed out to them.

<br/>

We recognize that marginalization can bring a lot of internalized hate, and
intend for this to be a safe space to process that. However, we still ask that
folks be mindful of spreading these sentiments on the public timeline, CW such
posts appropriately, and respect requests to mark them as followers-only.

<br/>

Likewise, marginalized people and communities taking the slurs (or other insulting and derogatory words) that target them and reappropriating them as positive words for themselves is allowed. If it's not about you, it's not your call.

<br/>

#### Generally unacceptable behaviour
These result in an immediate ban:

- Clearly being disrespectful or acting like an asshole.
- Telling someone to or suggesting that someone should commit suicide, be killed, or die. (even jokingly)
- Refusing to CW content that should be in a CW (see the Etiquette section), or refusing moderator requests to CW content.
- Advertising or preaching (promoting your own work is fine; being paid to shill/advertise for someone else is not fine)


This is also *super not okay*:

- Making sex jokes or flirting with someone when they haven't specifically said that's okay on their profile.

<br/>



#### Harassment and Threats
Any of these kinds of things will result in an immediate ban:

- Intentionally sending posts to someone that are designed to distress or insult them.
- Using posts, screenshots or out of context quotes to mock or make fun of someone else.
- Submitting false reports against someone else.
- Continuing to interact with someone after they have told you to stop.
- Threatening to harass, threatening to dox, threatening to DDoS, or any other kind of threat.
- Sexual harassment or acting in a sexually predatory way.

<br/>

#### Conspiracy theories, pseudoscience and scams

It's important that our server is a place for constructive ideas, and not ones that are used as weapons, tools of disinformation, or spreading information that can cause harm.

Some kinds of conspiracy talk and discussions of the occult and woo are fine, but these are examples of the kinds of things that are unacceptable here:

- Anti-vaxxer
- COVID denial/doomerism: ideologies normalizing the spread of COVID, rejecting risk mitigation such as masking and testing, etc.
- Climate change denial
- Flat earthers
- NWO, Illuminati, Chemtrails, Pizzagate, etc.
- Hate group conspiracy theories like Holocaust Denial.
- Pseudoscience like Homeopathy, 'healing crystals', etc.
- 'Creation Science' and other religious forms of pseudoscience.
- Promoting MLMs (Multi-Level Marketing schemes) or Ponzi schemes.
- Promoting, supporting, or using Weirder Earth to do business with cryptocurrency, NFTs, play-to-earn gaming, or the like. (Anti-cryptocurrency posting is permitted.)
- Promoting or supporting large data set neural nets designed to replace creative labor (e.g. LLMs like ChatGPT, Copilot, LLaMA; so-called "AI art" tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E), due to the exploitative and environmentally-destructive nature of their creation and use.

Guerrilla ontologies and similar things are absolutely fine.



<br/>

#### Sexual content involving minors

Do not flirt with someone who is under 18.

Do not post illustrated imagery featuring sexualised depictions *of people who appear to be underage*. Even if there's something saying they are over 18, they should *reasonably look like they are over 18*.

Do not post erotica involving minors.

Do not post child sexual abuse material.

Any of these will result in an immediate ban.

<br/>

#### FOSTA/SESTA

We are a sex-worker positive space and we openly advocate for sex worker
rights. Unfortunately, because the instance is owned by someone who lives on
US soil and hosted on US servers, you cannot solicit full-service
sex work from this instance, nor can you be a client for such. Other forms of
sex work, to the extent that they are legal in our jurisdiction, are permitted.

---

## Etiquette
These are general things to be aware of if you use our instance. You may not be used to them, and that's okay! We're willing to help you if you stumble along the way.

If a moderator asks you to repost something with a CW or asks you to change or delete a post for a particular reason outlined in this section, it doesn't mean you're in trouble. You're just being given a friendly pointer so you can help make this space awesome for everyone ðŸ˜„.

<br/>

### Local Timeline

*(Mastodon has different 'timelines' that different people can see - the Local Timeline is a timeline everyone in this instance can see. You post to it by choosing 'Public' (the globe icon) in your post toolbar.)*

We really want our Local Timeline to be an antidote to traditional social media posting; a more down to earth place where people talk about themselves and what they're up to.

- Let everyone have space to share things. Be selective about your Local posts and avoid posting too many things at once.
- Avoid posting lots of external links on the local timeline. We want everyone to share things about *themselves*, and reposting stuff from elsewhere can make the space feel impersonal.

<br/>

### Use CWs for sensitive content.

CWs (Content Warnings) are a really cool way for people to keep climate control over their Mastodon browsing experience. It's especially useful in these stressful times, but it's also useful if you or other people have particular mental health conditions or are just having a bad day.

You should CW a post when it contains any of the following topics, whether the content is good or bad. Feel free to add (+) for positive content, (~) for mixed content and (-) for negative content.

<br/>

- **Political current events** such as elections and government actions (normally abbreviated to 'pol' along with the country/region, ie. 'UKpol', 'DEpol', etc.)
- **Potentially triggering Mental Health topics** (normally abbreviated to 'mh'). *Many of our members come here to discuss their mental health journey, and we seek to be as welcoming and open as possible, but for the sake of other users: please CW references to self harm, suicide, helplessness and other moods and behaviours that may be contagious or trigger people in recovery*
- **Alcohol ('alc') and drugs**
- **Diet talk or weight loss** Discussion of dieting, including any judgments about "healthy food" even if you're not counting calories, should be CW'd differently from "ooh yummy" types of food posts.
- **Food in general**
- **Sexual themes or content**
- **Violent themes or content, blood and gore**
- **Themes or content about abuse**
- **Common phobias** (Like certain animals such as snakes and insects.)
- **Long posts or posts with multiple parts** (please also use the 'unlisted' privacy setting for posts after the first in a thread, so that the local timeline doesn't get flooded)
- **Content made with generative tools** like neural networks ("AI") and dissociated press/ebooks bot-style Markov chains that are **designed primarily to imitate art or communication made by people.** These can cause an uncanny-valley effect and can be distressing or frustrating when presented without warning.

Also CW images that have nudity or these areas of the body exposed:

- A certain area around the nipples (and/or the nipples themselves). From the end of the ribcage to the bust line.
- Anything less than what boxer briefs or shorts would cover around the groin area.

Please specify in the CW if the nudity contains genitals. This applies to all bodies regardless of gender.

We don't want to ask anyone to CW their identities. We particularly don't want to ask marginalized people to CW their marginalization. We're not going to be hardline about the rules in cases where there are compelling reasons to frame what you're saying differently...

...but "this is important, so I won't CW" and "this is urgent, so I won't CW" are non-sequiturs - the importance and the urgency have nothing to do with whether that content is more accessible with a content warning.

### On media descriptions

Weirder Earth encourages (but does not require - see below!) adding descriptions to images, videos, audio files, and so forth that you attach to your posts. On the web UI, you can click the "Edit" button in the top right to access the modal with the description box. Give it a shot even if you haven't tried before - you don't have to be expert to be helpful!

What makes a good description depends on what you post and why you post it. For example:

- **image or recording of words to be read/listened to:** put the full text in the description box so people can read/listen to it. (If it won't fit, thread it.)
- **artwork:** describe the style, contents, and mood, as best as you can.
- **informative illustration:** write text that can serve the same informative purpose.

In general, if you posted something for a reason, write a description accordingly. If it's an error message, say what went wrong. If it's a meme, tell us what's so funny (yes, even if it's not that funny). Heck, if it's your pet, gush about their cuteness, and if it's a horny selfie, be horny in your description! You're posting these things because you care, and you're allowed to care in your descriptions, too.

**If you can't add a media description, please do any of the following:**

* Add a note, in CW line or post body, that your media is undescribed.
* Add a request for description, as text or by using a custom emoji: `:describe_me:`, `:describe_me_outlined:`, or `:help_describe:`.
* Tag `@imagecaptionspls@a.gup.pe` or `#Alt4Me` to request help from others. (p.s. if you enjoy writing descriptions, follow that account or tag!)

In addition, if your main obstacle is just remembering to do it, you can follow `@PleaseCaption@botsin.space` - it'll follow you back and let you know if you post or boost undescribed content.

<br/>

### Be explicit about region-specific posts.

Keep in mind that Mastodon has users from all over the world.

If you have a post (like advice or politics) that's only relevant to a certain part of the world, mention what part of the world it is for.

<br/>

### Avoid subtooting when you can.

Subtooting (like subtweeting) is talking about something someone else has said without talking to the person who said it directly.

This is a tempting thing to do (and sometimes an ideal thing to do) if you don't want to get into a particular situation, but it has a negative side effect if you're not careful. It can make the entire environment hostile because subtooting can make people unsure whether you might be talking about them or not.

<br/>

### Be careful when considering giving unsolicited advice.

We try to be respectful of the opinions and views of others. Often unsolicited advice or proselytizing, while well intentioned, can never the less make a person feel like their beliefs, values, or experience are invalid. For this reason, you should err on the side of caution.

<br/>


### If you see something bad, tell your moderator(s).

Corporate social media like Twitter and Tumblr can often make people feel powerless to actually take people who behave badly out of the picture, and this can lead to an ecosystem where issues are taken out publicly, and they can create mobs that cause a lot of people stress and can also easily harm the wrong people.

Here, you have moderators who are willing and able to help you and investigate and deal with problems. Please don't post publicly about these issues, make a report or DM one of your local moderators.

<br/>

### Leave edgy humour and societal baggage at the door.

There are things you might be used to doing that you think are okay, but they actually hurt other people or make them feel unwelcome. 

You'll need to keep in mind that these are not okay and you shouldn't do these kinds of things if you decide to make an account here.

Here are some examples:

- Rape jokes
- Making jokes at the expense of content warnings ('triggered' jokes).
- Putting marginalised people in the position of having to defend or explain their marginalisation. It's *your* responsibility to do your own research.
- Microaggressions ([you can find some examples of what that kind of thing is here](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Microaggression))
- Using phrases similar to 'not all men...' when someone is just venting about something they've experienced. If you're not a part of the problem, then you don't need to see it as a personal attack.
- Not using CWs properly (see the CW section above for guidance).

We'll help you if you genuinely make mistakes along the way, but please really try to keep them in mind.
